Firstly, NYC is the most populous city in the United States with an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), which means it is also the most densely populated major city in the United States; However, compared with NYC, Toronto in Canada may have more population and larger urban area, but its density is much lower than NYC's. Besides NYC's high density, it has also been called as \"melting pot\" for its large population of international immigrants. Overall, since NYC has been considered the largest city in USA and also has been called \"metropolis\" for a long time, its neighborhood contains all kind of restaurants with different categories, such as Chinese, Indian, Italian food and etc, which provides me enough data and choices to do the analysis.
